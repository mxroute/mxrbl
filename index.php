MXRBL is a DNSRBL containing IPs and IP ranges known directly to be spammers that are strangely not listed at all of the most common RBLs. Our aim is to be fair and not operate with a god complex, unlike so many blacklists out there.
<br><br>
To use this blacklist, direct your DNS queries to bl.mxrbl.com. If you are not familiar with the accepted method, reverse the IP address and add ".bl.mxrbl.com" at the end. Example: 170.130.140.177 becomes 177.140.130.170.bl.mxrbl.com.

June 9th Update: There may be intermittent failures where IPs that should be blacklisted appear to not be. This is due to an upgrade taking place. This message will be removed when it is complete.
